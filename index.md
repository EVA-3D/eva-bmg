# BMG

![preview](assets/__ALL__.png)

This one is one of my favourites, like the Titan one the filament path is not super short but that's an exchange for the modularity EVA provides, also it does not seem to make much difference. EVA 2 / BMG is compatible with both the standard BMG and BMG-M for all hotend options.  
I'm personally using this EVA drive variant.
